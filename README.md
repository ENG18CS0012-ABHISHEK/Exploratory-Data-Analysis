# World Population Analysis: An Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on a world population dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Key steps include data cleaning, statistical summaries, and identifying patterns through correlation analysis and visualization. By grouping data by continent and examining population trends from 1970 to 2022, the project highlights insights into population growth across different continents. Visualizations such as heatmaps, line charts, and box plots provide a clear picture of population distribution and trends, making this project a comprehensive exploration of global population data.
