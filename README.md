# World Population Analysis: An Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on a world population dataset extracted from Kaggle, using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Key steps include data cleaning, generating statistical summaries, and identifying patterns through correlation analysis and visualization. By grouping data by continent and examining population trends from 1970 to 2022, the project highlights insights into population growth across different regions. Visualizations such as heatmaps, line charts, and box plots provide a comprehensive view of global population distribution and trends over time.
